            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>We are the official water ski team of Texas A&M University and our purpose is to promote interest in water skiing and 
                its related activities among the students, faculty, and staff of TAMU. We are one of 38 sports clubs sponsored by the 
                <a href="https://recsports.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M Department of Recreational Sports</a> and we meet every Tuesday at 8 
                p.m. in Room 1132 of the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/A9CrczcPv46fwwjQ9">Student Recreation Center</a>. Through <a href="https://www.usawaterski.org/">USA Water Ski</a> 
                and the <a href="https://www.ncwsa.com/">National Collegiate Water Ski Association</a>, we compete in 3-event water 
                skiing (slalom, trick, and jump) against other schools in the <a href="https://www.ncwsascr.org/">South Central Region</a>. 
                These other schools include the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, the University of Louisiana at Monroe, Texas 
                State University, the University of Texas at Austin, Baylor University, the University of Arkansas, and Southern 
                Methodist University. We travel to seven tournaments a year, and host daily “practices” at our lake 20 miles from 
                campus in Iola, TX. Members are not required to compete, or attend any team events; everything is optional and at your 
                own pace! We are always looking for new members. Whether you are a seasoned pro, a recreational skier, or someone who 
                is interested in simply getting on top of the water; we welcome you!</p>

            <h3>Slalom</h3>
            <p>The slalom event is performed on a single, narrow ski, with one foot placed directly in front of the 
                other. The athlete must navigate around six buoys placed on alternating sides of the boat's path in a zigzag course 
                without falling or missing a buoy. Each successful buoy rounded earns the athlete one point, and the skier with the 
                most points wins. The event begins with a 23-meter (75-foot) slalom rope at the minimum boat speed for the skier's 
                division. As the skier successfully completes passes and reaches the maximum boat speed for their division, the 
                rope is shortened in pre-measured lengths, increasing the difficulty of clearing the buoys. The skier must enter 
                through the entrance gates, round all six buoys, and exit through the exit gates to complete a pass, with points 
                awarded based on the number of buoys cleared, boat speed, and rope length.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <h3>Trick</h3>
            <p>The trick event, described as the most technical of the three events, involves performing as many tricks as possible 
                during one 20-second pass. Beginners use two short skis, while intermediate to elite athletes perform on a single 
                short ski with one foot in front and the other angled behind it. Each trick, whether a spin, flip, or other stunt, has 
                an assigned point value and can only be performed once. The more difficult the trick, the more points it is worth. 
                Tricks can be performed with the handle held in the athlete's hands, known as hand tricks, or with the foot slipped 
                into a strap attached to the handle, known as toehold tricks. Advanced trick skiers demonstrate excellent balance, 
                coordination, gymnastic ability, and precision. Although classic trick skiing is typically done on a specific type of 
                trick ski, points can also be earned by tricking on a wakeboard, kneeboard, or combo skis. The athlete who earns the 
                most points wins the event.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <h3>Jump</h3>
            <p>The goal of the jump event is for an athlete to jump as far as possible, with no points being awarded for style — just 
                launch off the ramp and fly! Each athlete has three attempts to achieve their longest jump, with set boat speeds and 
                ramp heights varying by division. Most divisions use a ramp height of five feet (1.5 meters), but elite women jump at 
                5.5 feet (1.6 meters) and elite men at six feet (1.8 meters). While average jump distances range from 80 to 170 feet 
                (24 to 52 meters), the men's world record is an impressive 254 feet (77.4 meters). Jumping is done on two large, wide 
                skis, typically taller than the skier, who wears a padded jumpsuit and helmet for protection. Skiers are scored on the 
                distance traveled from the end of the ramp to where they land and ski away. Beginners usually approach the ramp head-on 
                at the boat's speed, while experienced jumpers typically increase their approach distance to gain speed and achieve 
                longer jumps.</p>

            <h2>FAQ</h1>
            <h3>I am not very good at skiing, will I fit in?</h3>
            <p>There are many people who join our club just for their love of the water! We enjoy teaching people to do new things so 
                don't be shy!</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <h3>What does the lake have to offer?</h3>
            <p>We have equipment for use by club members; slalom skis, trick skis, jump skis, life jackets, wakeboards, wakeskates, 
                slalom course, jump ramp, and a BRAND NEW 2024 MasterCraft Prostar!</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <h3>What are the dues?</h3>
            <p>Dues are $325 for the semester. This goes to cover boat cost, lake rent, gas for the boat, transportation and lodging 
                for tournaments, club equipment repair, and general maintenance. Your first trip to the lake is free if you would like 
                to come check out the team, but we can only allow this once. The second time out, we require full dues, which means you 
                would owe $325. Sorry, we wish skiing was free too. You can pay dues to an officer in either cash or a check made out 
                to TAMU Water Ski.</p>
